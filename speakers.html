<h2>Information for Speakers</h2><p> The seminar room is equipped with a data projector and a computer running acrobat and powerpoint. The easiest thing is for speakers to bring their talk on a memory stick to be transferred onto this computer. If you require special software then you can bring your own laptop and use it for your presentation.</p>
