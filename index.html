<p>This workshop is an interface meeting between statisticians and
machine learning researchers. The subject of the meeting will be
multiple output Gaussian processes (also known as cokriging and
multi-task kernel learning).

<p>The objective of the meeting is to bring a small group of selected
researchers together to try and exchange issues and ideas in an effort
to determine interesting future challenges and common directions of
research. The list of invitees is drawn heavily from researchers in
the MUCM project, UK ML researchers interested in GPs and known
international people with an interest in this area.

<p>The meeting will take place across two days. There is no
registration fee for the invited attendees, but you will have to
cover your own travel and accommodation costs.

<p>Our aim is to have a further workshop at the NIPS conference in
Vancouver where we will also interface with researchers that interpret
covariance functions as kernels in Hilbert spaces and use multi-output
covariance functions in "multi-task learning".
